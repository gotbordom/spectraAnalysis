Description: This was used for research to visualize HDF5 datasets.
Details:
loadSpectra.py: 
  - If you run this file with an HDF5 file with the spectra it will load all the datasets into python np.arrays
    - 1st argument is hdf5 path/filename
    - 2nd argument is dataset you want loaded from the hdf5 file
		- May want HDFView software if you don't known the structure of your hdf5 file. 
		- Without the second argument this will just load all datasets it finds. If using my data, then that will be a lot of data.
